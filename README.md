# Grocery-List-2.0
This is an interactive grocery list where users can modify their lists to fit their needs.

I titled this code Grocery List 2.0 because this is the modified version of a previous coding project. 

Users can add food items, remove food items, mark items as completed, alphabetize the list, clear the list, view the list, view the number of items on the list, and quit the program. The users are prompted with a menu where they choose which action item they want to pursue in the program. The different action items are numbered 1-8. When prompted with the question of what action item the user wants to pursue, they must respond by inputting the number of the item. To add food items, the user must individually input the name of the food item they want to add. The tricky thing with the program is that the user must count the first item on their list as "item 0", the second item as "item 1", and so on. This is described to the user in the program but could use some updating.
